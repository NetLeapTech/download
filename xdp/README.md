# Encrypted Repository Notice

This repository contains multiple encrypted modules. **Each module has a unique encryption key** that must be obtained individually. Unauthorized access or use of these modules is prohibited.

## Important Usage Information

- **Main Module**: The main module requires a specific configuration file for operation. Without this preset configuration, the system may become locked.
  
- **Key Management**: Since each module uses a different key, please request and retrieve each key in separate batches as needed.

**⚠️ Warning**: Please proceed with caution when handling and deploying these modules, particularly with the main module, to prevent accidental system lockouts.
